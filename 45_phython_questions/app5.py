# Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and
# include some whitespace characters at the beginning 
# and end of the name. Make sure you use each character
# combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name
# once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
# Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

# Storing the person's name with whitespace characters
name = "\t\n Anna shah \n\t"

# Print the name with the whitespace displayed

print(name)

# Print the name after stripping the whitespace
print("Name after stripping whitespace:")
print(name.strip())
