# Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series 
# of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
# • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

# • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array.
# If the fruit is in your array, 
# the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
