# Greetings: Start with the array you used in 
# Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
# print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
# but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

friends_name=['aqsa','sunny','shan','anna']
for name in friends_name:
    print(f"Hello {name}, I hope you are having a great day!")
